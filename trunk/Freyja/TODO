  General
	o FIX normal gen using mesh center points
	o Bounding box selection made into 2 events:
	   1. bounding box selection
	   2. operation on selection ( not just vertex buffer default )
	o Object Copy / Cut / Paste for more than just meshes
	o Undo system, refine event system
	o Interactive plugins
	o Recently used files list
	o Light editing mode
	o Remove all unused/obsolete events and cmds
	o Mouse interface needs to replace plane based editing
	o Vertex morphing animation ( was removed during fork )
	o Matrix palette skinning ( not supported due to old Egg backend )

  Interface
	o Make tree labels updatable w/o reloading the entire tree
	o Animation playback
	o Make new mesh for new polygon when none exist
	o Generated Spheres use duplicate vertices, unexpected by users
	o Arcball for mouse rotation
	o Generic rotate/translate/scale mouse interface (mesh/tag/etc)
	o Use event timer for idle rotation and animation display
	o Add multiwindow modeling support back?
