  File     : TODO ( 2004.12.04 last update )
  Author   : Terry 'Mongoose' Hendrix II
  Project  : Freyja 0.3.x

 ---------------------------------------------------------------
	Design by contract ( DBC )
	Do no Repeat Yourself ( DRY )

     1. Remove duplicate functionality ( DRY )
     2. Enforce assertions, when assertions are made ( DBC )
     3. Audit memory managment code regularly
     4. Unit testing

  General
	o Deform skelmesh in bone transform
	o Vertex extrude with quads
	o Multi window editing using python via calls to FreyjaRender
	o Deform vertices render option ( disables mesh editing )
	o Skeletal Ref -> Skeletal Keyframe ( dup | edit ) -> Skel Keyframe |
	  vertex morph frame 
	o Bounding box vertex selector for bones
	o GRN edit / export request -- fix GRN animation import
	o Tightening up import / export -- if it's not 100% or close
	  it's going to get disabled or feature locked till it is
	o Propagate import / export list up to Freyja to make menus
	o Merge down umbra system over stable to make ABI/API compatible
	  plugins
	o OO event system may need to come online right after release
	o Python extention to mgtk/Freyja for interactive plugins
	o <Mongoose> someone should write a perlin vol texture plugin for freyja
	  hehehe
	o Animation save doesn't warn on overwrite -- do that
	o Curved surfaces in backend, remove patch test
	o Fix bones/skeletal system backend or even switch to umbra
	o Face selection and grouping for operations like normal generation
	o Relative/Ray based light movement with mouse in animator tab
	o Full MDL(HL), GRN, PSK import/export support
	o Make Egg/Freyja backend's plugins ABI compatible and merge them
	  into a shared branch
	o Make plugin to load Egg 8.12 models independent of backend
	o Vertex morphing animation as extension ( was removed during fork )
	o Remove all unused/obsolete events, functions, and cmds
	o Object Copy/Cut/Paste for more than just meshes
	o Undo system
	o Recently used files list
	o Instead of 'mCleared' events focus on 'mModified' events in Control
	o Light editing mode backport
	o Mouse interface needs to replace purely plane based editing
	o Skeletal mesh deform edit/render/off toggles to solve interface issue?
	o Matrix palette skinning 
	  ( Not supported in Egg backend, but I think it can be done
	    via my old metadata system -- yay for thinking ahead or an extension )

  Interface
	o Make tree labels updatable w/o reloading the entire tree
	o Animation playback
	o Make new mesh for new polygon when none exist?
	  ( could be bad or good, perhaps allow a freyja.mlisp toggle for it )
	o Generated Spheres use duplicate vertex rings toggle for solid?
	  ( unexpected by users? )
	o Arcball for mouse rotation
	o Use event timer for idle rotation and animation display
	o Add multiwindow modeling support back?
