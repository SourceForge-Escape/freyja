 ---------------------------------------------------------------

  Programming wish list guidelines:
    1. Remove duplicate functionality
    2. Fix all FIXMEs when possible
    3. Check assertions, when assertions are made
    4. Audit memory managment code regularly
    5. Replace temporary hacks with robust, clean code
    6. Make and use test code per module/class
    7. Abstraction is law, or something
    8. Document as code is written

 [Development 0.9.0]
  Egg v9 prototype migration, to replace v8 API

    + Vertices: 
       Types {normal, wieghted}
       Also getting a new interface to them for rendering that 
       doesn't use indirect access (slow)
    + Texel: 
       Removing this in favor of vertices with UV lists?
       Needs more testing, may keep it for non weighted verts
    + Polygons:
       Direct vertex data access ( fast ) along with indirect
       Shader system hooks
    + Meshes: 
       Types {morph frame, weighted, normal}
    + Bolt-ons
       No longer refered to as bone tags
    + Boneframes/Animation frames
       Will include 'real' bones as well as tags or may be 
       broken into BoneFrames 1..N and AnimationFrame types
    + Bones
       Skeletal modeling using weighted vertices ( only 2 types? )
    + Metadata
       Markers will be the same as 8.09 
       ( Keep lights and other misc types under this? )
    + Animation
       Should stay the same with indirect access to BoneFrames
       if they stay one type, else it'll be expanded to index 1:1
       for new types
    + Shader 
       Shader prototype subsystem merge with egg
    + Particle
       Particle prototype subsystem merge with egg
    + Utils
       New math API with more robust quaterion support
