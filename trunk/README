 Read ChangeLog for details about this and other releases.

 Check TODO to see when a feature you want is due.  Also
 track CVS to get sometime daily updates to the codebase.

 Read the FAQ or visit irc.linux.com #freyja for help and 
 tips.  If you'd like to help email or visit the channel, 
 because I need help with things from writing plugins to
 more formal testing.  Read BUGS and ChangLog also.  =)
