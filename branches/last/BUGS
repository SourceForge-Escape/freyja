  039. 2004.03.27 Mongoose
       Texture loading can *segfault* on MDL + palette load

       Texture loading doesn't seem to hold slots, and switching
       textures in skin view seems to destroy them relates to #030?


   037. 2002.03.03 Mongoose
       Animation view is broken due to removing rotation
       view system from FreyjaModel


  036. 2002.03.03 Mongoose
       Texel editor is broken, due to new vertex.uv use


  035. 2002.03.03 Mongoose
       Texture loading uses new indexing scheme 
       ( breaks plugins using old scheme )
       * To fix use a texture id translator like for vertices
       

  033. 2002.01.27 Mongoose
       Mesh Rotate requires a Mesh Move first ( egg 8.10 bug )


  031. 2001.10.29 Mongoose
       3d widget doesn't refresh properly now - caused by
       removal of event_refesh() calls

       Let this stay broken to make sure event system
       is replaced sooner  =)


  028. 2001.10.28 Mongoose
       Renderering is slow - move quickly to new backend,
       since the data structures are the real bottleneck


  027. Mesh->move doesn't work very well with mouse
       seems to use improper offsets using zoom 

       Also it uses vertices for movement tracking ( bad )


  026. Check and test for endian issues


  025. Tree for browsing/editing animations ( DnD frame manager )
       isn't finished

  024. No vertex morphing animation support in new release


  023. Animation mode mouse rotation needs to be replaced;
       it's very annoying to spin and spin w/o much movement
       and only 2 axe movement at that 
       ( quat trackball would be a good new method )


  022. Hardcoded keys suck - add back RC scripting for them


  020. Full disk write fail not reported for screen shot

  038. 2002.03.03 Mongoose
       Screenshot broken due to frame swapping while taken
       * You could disable mouse like particle does first
         then reenable ( mouse causes redraw on ANY click )

       New GL draw order fixed this, but widgets can dirty
       screen on older gtk+ libs still


  034. 2002.02.01 Mongoose / 2002.02.01 Mongoose
       Combined vertices act like bone controled when doing
       mesh ops b/c the ops are applied for 'dead' vertex
       over the replacement after it was already altered

       Removed instead of replaced overwriting vertex in group


  030. 2001.10.29 Mongoose / 2002.01.21 Mongoose
       Texture slot loading damages texture list, ordered
       loading is fine

       Seems to have went away after 0.3.x refactoring
       isn't that nice  =)


  032. 2002.01.17 Mongoose / 2002.01.18 Mongoose
       Mouse screen/3d world coor are screwed since
       new gnome/control use

       FreyjaControl::Mouse passed arg in wrong order to
       FreyjaControl::MouseEdit ( in new modifier parm code )


  029. 2001.10.28 Mongoose / 2001.10.28 Mongoose
       Bones don't render with proper end point for all trees

       
  021. 2001.10.29 Mongoose / ??
       Repeated texture loading fails in shader mode, and
       also 'washes' when switching into and out of shader
       mode afterward.

       Also screws up multiload textures.
