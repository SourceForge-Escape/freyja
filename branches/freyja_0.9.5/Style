 Style Guidelines Codification
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Attributes start with "m" prefix to avoid issues with "_" in some compilers.  

 * Camel case method names starting with capital letter.

 * Keep sections as needed in larger classes and methods alphanumeric sorted.

 * Stop prototyping in header files -- make a new object before you start.

 * Use comment blocks for method description.  No per method histories in header!

 * Place inline methods over 1 line outside class defn at the bottom of the header.
