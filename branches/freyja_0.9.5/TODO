		- Let's give Lua it's own symbol table using a 'table'.
	- Mlisp symbol table exposed in Lua for event system use.
	- Expose things like control points via libfreyja backend.
 	- Widgets: lua mgtk wrapper to allow full interface plugins.

	- Depends on proper Cmake support of cross compiler(s).
	- Possibly support generic strip and package rules too.
	- http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Cross_Compiling

 * Swap file for crash recovery and very, very large undo.

 * The way the model graph works in 0.9.5 with all the extensions is 
   going to have to be redesigned for 0.9.6 alpha.
	- Edge based editing as a focus instead of vertex.
	- Better reference graphs so you can tell how vertex/edge/facets are 
	  connected and interact -- also to give speed boosts for common ops.
	- Mesh should be broken up into subclasses eg 'weightmanager', 'utils'.

 * Verify math library, enforce automated testing at build.
	- Make sure everything is using col hel::Mat44 correctly now.
		- 'Raypick vs FK'
	- Make sure everything is converting between types properly.
	- Use this as a chance to rework types for 0.9.6.
		- Rename hel/math.h hel/hel.h for 0.9.6.

 * Refactor the file dialog code based on the new import/export test.
	- Reduce the import/export test.
	- Likely go with the popular 'guesser' for open and native for save.

 * Cursor
 	- Quat based rotation cursor?
	- Rotation modifier can 'lock' and may want bigger targets for general use.
	- Rotation not reset before object creation/selection sometimes causing bug.
	- Transform has a 'pop' or 'jump' in model mode.

 * UV unwrap improvements.
	- Add unwrap to cyn uvmap ( no overlayed uv polygons, fill quad, etc )

 * Add the simple Bezier patch polygon mesh back.

 * Merge pak vfs into main UI.  Currently it's an awkward UI plugin.
	- Change vfs file list to have mixed dir/files in one pane to follow HIG.

 * Improve mesh render support.
 	- VBO callback for rmesh (de)alloc / (un)lock ( allows VBOs )
	- Remove the old crappy scaling for zoom.
	- Color array / material color support wouldn't be a bad idea.
	- Perhaps limit the modeler to quads/tris... always a sore subject  =)
	- MeshRenderInstance or rework old Mesh, since it has to sync anyway
		- mFaceIndices
		- mPolyMappedVertices
		- mPolyMappedNormals
		- mPolyMappedTexcoords
		- DepthSortAlphaFaces(Ray) - Make a new index array for depth sorting.

 * Option for 'autoview' so you can have view options set as edit mode requires.

 * paint support for vertex weld?

 * Vertex extrude

 * Separate grid toggle for the non-orbit windows ( should center on axis too )

 * Undo for subdiv / dmap

	- eg rotate all selected bones to 'follow target'

 * UV toggle alpha face flag

 * UV mirror via scale

 * sphere brush for paint tool

 * XML link support eg <link-ref filename="miko-weight.xml" type="weight" />
	- This XML file depends upon another one to be loaded as well.

 * Texture buffer expansion:
	- Texture / GLSL Shader instance manager ( as cache )
 	- Options to rotate pixmaps? 
	- diffuse, heightmap, normalmap, specular map, decal map, etc

 * Scenegraph: requires 'view' mode vs 'edit' mode

 * Plugins using cmake build system.

 * HID
	- Grouping to reduce number of widgets.
 		. Light options with drop down menu button: dir/pos/spot?
 		. Grid view options with drop down menu button. eg: wire/solid
 		. Bone names option as drop down for bone visibily?

	- Render Faces... has no transforms 'previews'.
		. Use vertex blend buffer while editing and 'state write' with token.

	- Moving out of 'this is for developers' to 'this is for users'.
		. Time to start hiding debugging toggles instead of on front shelf.

	- Two window view mode support.

	- 'Size' cursor 'recenters' -- floor on Y value to avoid confusing people?

	- Bones type visibility 'hard set' by edit mode.

	- View mode toggles ( chords ) into edit modes ( radio type ).

	- Shading for editing flat / face normal / etc



 Freyja, Dancer/Kagura 0.9.6 (Public Alpha-Beta, TBD)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Formalized unit tests and reporting.

 	- Remove anything depending on parsestringliteral string allocation.
	- It might be a good idea to have true vector and vectorarray containers.
	- hash
	- avl_tree
	- splay_tree for cache mostly
	- Allow API compatibility breaks as needed.
	- Rewrite Map and RedBlackTree as map and rb_tree.  ( use stl like methods )

 * APIs / designs to be finalized
	- Optmize Mesh to avoid wasting texCoords when unused by vertices
	- Use status bar for mouse over tooltips also?

	- Object proprieties dialog?
		- Hidden property / Show object
		- Visibility layers using flags
	- Cg support plugin?
	- Force Copy / Cut / Paste / Dupe / Split / Merge for every object type?
	- Multi-object modes might need new UI design to avoid user confusion?
	- Add material colors for 'editing while rendering'? ( seems bad idea )
	- Face extruding maybe doesn't need to be pick ray guided (confusing?)
	- Hook up UV transforms, and flesh them out.
	- Track and Keyframe classes 
		- Keyframe vector issue
	- Add Meld/fMuted support for Vertex operations in Mesh
	- Add menu action to clamp texcoords on selected Mesh
	- Fix all remaining mesh issues like uv editing and manual welds
	- Mesh::Merge() doesn't merge animations ( shouldn't matter? )
	- Mesh::WeldTexCoords() is non-functional.

 * Visual scaling of cursors may need to be adjusted during zoom != 1.0f
	- This means sphere/ray targets must be scaled to match visual also

 * Brush system for vertex weight and texture on model painting

 * Material sphere rotation controlled by slider.

 * Certain modes should enable certain rendering options by default, but allow
   user overrides too.  eg [Vertex] + [Select] enables point renderer.

 * Full Light editor.

 * Camera editor.

 * Async I/O test with special memory pool, etc ( killable I/O threads )

 * Texture buffer array per material for: diffuse/normal/gloss/data/dudv/etc

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * GNOME MIME setup script

 * PluginManager ( enable / disable plugins, descriptions, etc )

 * Log window for more complete error / warning reporting.

 * Import/export plugin changes
	- dropdown should change filename
	- Threaded import/export?
		- fLocked support
		- fSelectedFIO support
	- Detailed error messages ( Pass back a String to generate msgbox ) 
	- FreyjaType flags usage ( eg mesh only, mesh+skeleton, etc )
	- Freyja selection usage ( eg export selected )
	- Optional memory buffer usage instead of file/url ( great for paks )
	- These could be setup inside of per plugin preferences, so
		  the ABI doesn't have to change ala states
	- Open/Save buttons on filedialogs

 * Import/Export submenus like the Plugins.. submenu
	- Selection mask support
	- File dialogs should be able to auto append correct extensions.

 * Viewport view / control abstraction

	- Add camera editing back

 * GLSL shaders
	- FreyjaOpenGL should remap shaders to make sure two of the same
		  shader aren't loaded at once ( just pass back the orig program id )
	- Refraction demo shader ( turbulence with frag prob best )
	- Depth of field demo shader

 * Octree for vertex/object pick culling and rendering optimization.

 * Projectors.

 * Phong Lighting.  ( Just add toggle for the GLSL shader? )

 * Misc
 	- Ensure no transform algorithms are not done in client.
	- Move all transforms in UI to ::Transform and hook-up undo/redo for all
	- Edge editing needs to be top level 'edit type' like face in UI
	- Face splitting needs to be user controllable
	- Stiching mode for making faces from existing vertices
		- This is an old 'Fan favorite' feature of freyja that was removed
		- Stiching existing vertices should be a seperate mode
		- This new implementation will use control points and a quad/tri
			  strip mode for the control point renderer to avoid writes to mesh
		- Have the user press <ctrl> mouse2 to generate the polygons

 Rendering
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Material tree/node editor

 * Animated texcoords

 * glColorMaterial optional use

 * Shadow maps and volumes

 * Different skyboxes/floors w/ water reflection for animation view


 Event system / Interface
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * libmgtk specific
	- 'Radio object' to auto uncheck toggle event when others trigger
	- Mlisp to replace aging Resource based mlisp domain language
	- MlispEvent to replace ResourceEvent
	- Mlisp doesn't lookup symbols for like "true" if just setq
		- This is by design, but maybe it should change now.

 * Interface
	- Two window layout for curve / viewport usage
	- Make viewport 'windows' abstract with seperate controls
		- Support for dynamic resizing and 2/3/4 layouts
		- FreyjaRender -> OpenGLContext, *ViewportRenderer
		- FreyjaControl -> Freyja3d, *ViewportControl
		- Combine controls and view into a seperate class/pkg
			  This will make it easier to scale and fix UI issues
	- Camera render mode for viewport
		- OpenGL depth / culling / etc control?
	- Remove state value from all mlisp toggle widgets ( use the set func )
	- Have a widget numeric set function like toggle widgets have for bool 
	- VFS UI needs to provide metadata like XOR keys, size, offset, etc		- Extra viewmode to toggle groups colors on/off
	- Two-way python function/script UI, reporting ala C plugins
		  or offically endorse pygtk, etc

   * Scene tree view for all objects in scene
	- Parenting interface

 * Cursor system
	- Consistency across cursor usage
	- Orbital / Camera view need special orientation constraints
	- Hierarchical systems like skeletons need fixes for world cursor 
	- Object modifiers should update cursor loc/rot/size only
		- On object select update cursor values
		- On modifier mode update cursor values via a 'bump' select (reuse)
	- Rotation cursor with radius sweeps to cursor pos following an arc
		- Also replace the old RotateObject() code to just use cursor
		  on select mode switch as per new design to prevent feedback loops
	- Ray/Vector based orbital view cursor guides ( 'go where I want' )
	- Rotation cursor needs final, real implementation added now
		- Circle around projected center or do something equally clever
			  for more tactical control
	- Vertex ops undo (all)
	- Render changes and constantly update
	- Enforce rule when confirmed by click actually modify
	- Opposite mouse click 'undo' by not modifying
	- Don't scale cursor
	- Cursor rotation pivot setting for vertices

 * Event system refinement { Undo, Redo, Macro, Playback }

 * Enforce usage of Observer and Command patterns for all events

 * Generic control points refinement

 * Multiple select ops vs single select


 Misc
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Refactor to use true singletons/other patterns where systems require

 * Simulation package revival

 * DBUS support now that it's hit stable ABI at 1.0?

 * Physics

 * L-System


 Style Guidelines Codification
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Attributes start with "m" prefix to avoid issues with "_" in some compilers.  

 * Camel case method names starting with capital letter.

 * Keep sections as needed in larger classes and methods alphanumeric sorted.

 * Stop prototyping in header files -- make a new object before you start.

 * Use comment blocks for method description.  No per method histories!

 * Place inline methods over 1 line go outside class defn at the bottom of the header.
