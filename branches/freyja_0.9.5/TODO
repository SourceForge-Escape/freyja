	- Make sure everything is converting between types properly.

 * Fix mouse cursor control.
	- Reverse direction bug.

	- Transform has a 'pop' or 'jump' in model and mesh modes

 * Basic geometry previews using blend vertices buffer - avoid data mutators.

 * Add back ray picking for UV faces to the UV editor.

 * Finish breakup of GUI control into modules.

 * Finish up the icon set.

 * MSTL review for possible rewrite.  Wish: generic container item, opt, etc.

 * Do another pass on 0.9.6 items to be sure they aren't already completed.


 Freyja, Dancer/Kagura 0.9.6 (Public Alpha-Beta, TBD)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Review build system for a possible move back to autotools.

 * Review build system for possible cmake support.

		- Hidden property / Show object
		- Visibility layers using flags
	- Cg support plugin?
	- Force Copy / Cut / Paste / Dupe / Split / Merge for every object type?
	- Multi-object modes might need new UI design to avoid user confusion?
	- Add material colors for 'editing while rendering'? ( seems bad idea )
	- Face extruding maybe doesn't need to be pick ray guided (confusing?)
	- Hook up UV transforms, and flesh them out.
	- Track and Keyframe classes 
		- Keyframe vector issue
	- Add Meld/fMuted support for Vertex operations in Mesh
	- Add menu action to clamp texcoords on selected Mesh

 Freyja, Dancer/Kagura 0.9.6 (Beta-Release, TBD)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * GNOME MIME setup script

 * PluginManager ( enable / disable plugins, descriptions, etc )

 * Log window for more complete error / warning reporting.

 * Query dialog with multitype support.
		struct query { string msg, type defaultvalue, type eventId }

 * Import/export plugin changes
	- dropdown should change filename
	- Threaded import/export?
		- fLocked support
		- fSelectedFIO support
	- Detailed error messages ( Pass back a String to generate msgbox ) 
	- FreyjaType flags usage ( eg mesh only, mesh+skeleton, etc )
	- Freyja selection usage ( eg export selected )
	- Optional memory buffer usage instead of file/url ( great for paks )
	- These could be setup inside of per plugin preferences, so
		  the ABI doesn't have to change ala states
	- Open/Save buttons on filedialogs

 * Import/Export submenus like the Plugins.. submenu
	- SMD plugin option to save mesh prompt
	- Selection mask support
	- Flags for disabling mesh/skeleton/animations/etc
	- File dialogs should be able to handle 
		  *.ms3d and auto append instead of doing *.milkshape

 * Viewport view / control abstraction
	- Reimplement and enable Camera system
	- Add camera editing back

 * GLSL shaders
	- FreyjaOpenGL should remap shaders to make sure two of the same
		  shader aren't loaded at once ( just pass back the orig program id )
	- Refraction demo shader ( turbulence with frag prob best )
	- Depth of field demo shader

 * Misc
	- Move all transforms in UI to ::Transform and hook-up undo/redo for all
	- Edge editing needs to be top level 'edit type' like face in UI
	- Face splitting needs to be user controllable
	- Stiching mode for making faces from existing vertices
		- This is an old 'Fan favorite' feature of freyja that was removed
		- Stiching existing vertices should be a seperate mode
		- This new implementation will use control points and a quad/tri
			  strip mode for the control point renderer to avoid writes to mesh
		- Have the user press <ctrl> mouse2 to generate the polygons

	- Paint with ray test
	- DMAP geometery brush interface
	- Weight painting			
	- Paint on texture with GIMP interface hooks
	- Bbox/Sphere/Magnet brushes

 * Surfaces
	- Patch ABI

 * libfreyja specific
	- Refine 0.9.x ABI / API
	- Merge 'Dancer' libfreyja 0.10 editor features and plugins
	- Documentation
	- State machine should only use C API for abstraction
	- Fix Collapse edges, etc req vertex refs
	- Add vertex/polygon list based texcoord mapping methods to ABI
	- Add subdiv algorithms like catmull-clark, n-patches, etc
	- Add polymesh CSG back ( face intersection )
	- Subdivision Loop and Sabin/Doo surfaces
	- Mesh/Vertex mirroring
	- Polymapped normal support? ( or UVMapped/smoothing group normals )
	- Primitives: Cone / Disk / Cylinder ? ( Not polygonal interface )
	- API interfaces for 'Copy/cut/paste' and 'Rot/Pos/Scale/etc'?

 * Lasso and improved bounding box selections

 * Gobal mesh UIDs ala bones/joints to remove need for model+mesh reference

 * UI to toggle group color rendering and set color

 * Mesh / Vertex / Face transforms fully working in dev branch

 * Billboard/sprite support outside edit data for user diagrams and icons

 * Polygon winding control ccw/cw/etc, and render culling options

 * Interactive Tristrip creation tool to replace the old point and connect
   	  polgon creation some people seem to love

 * Selected mesh shader / color option

 * Make Mesh enforce only 1 kind of Face type in the sense of:
	- PolyMapping UV / Normal / etc

 * Better UV unwrap ( write smart algorithms for projections )

 * Allow user to set radius of vertex and texcoord picks ( hook up )

 * Add back transforms for selected faces/groups in UV editor

 Animation
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Curves support for keyframe editor

 * Bone H-matrix / inverted H-matrix

 * Bones with transforms in/outside of hierarchy


 Rendering
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Material tree/node editor

 * Animated texcoords

 * glColorMaterial optional use

 * Shadow maps and volumes

 * Different skyboxes/floors w/ water reflection for animation view


 Event system / Interface
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * libmgtk specific
	- 'Radio object' to auto uncheck toggle event when others trigger
	- Mlisp to replace aging Resource based mlisp domain language
	- MlispEvent to replace ResourceEvent
	- Mlisp doesn't lookup symbols for like "true" if just setq
		- This is by design, but maybe it should change now.

 * Interface
	- Two window layout for curve / viewport usage
	- Make viewport 'windows' abstract with seperate controls
		- Support for dynamic resizing and 2/3/4 layouts
		- FreyjaRender -> OpenGLContext, *ViewportRenderer
		- FreyjaControl -> Freyja3d, *ViewportControl
		- Combine controls and view into a seperate class/pkg
			  This will make it easier to scale and fix UI issues
	- Camera render mode for viewport
		- OpenGL depth / culling / etc control?
	- Remove state value from all mlisp toggle widgets ( use the set func )
	- Have a widget numeric set function like toggle widgets have for bool 
	- VFS UI needs to provide metadata like XOR keys, size, offset, etc		- Extra viewmode to toggle groups colors on/off
	- Two-way python function/script UI, reporting ala C plugins
		  or offically endorse pygtk, etc

   * Scene tree view for all objects in scene
	- Parenting interface

 * Cursor system
	- Consistency across cursor usage
	- Orbital / Camera view need special orientation constraints
	- Hierarchical systems like skeletons need fixes for world cursor 
	- Object modifiers should update cursor loc/rot/size only
		- On object select update cursor values
		- On modifier mode update cursor values via a 'bump' select (reuse)
	- Rotation cursor with radius sweeps to cursor pos following an arc
		- Also replace the old RotateObject() code to just use cursor
		  on select mode switch as per new design to prevent feedback loops
	- Ray/Vector based orbital view cursor guides ( 'go where I want' )
	- Rotation cursor needs final, real implementation added now
		- Circle around projected center or do something equally clever
			  for more tactical control
	- Vertex ops undo (all)
	- Render changes and constantly update
	- Enforce rule when confirmed by click actually modify
	- Opposite mouse click 'undo' by not modifying
	- Don't scale cursor
	- Cursor rotation pivot setting for vertices

 * Event system refinement { Undo, Redo, Macro, Playback }

 * Enforce usage of Observer and Command patterns for all events

 * Generic control points refinement

 * Multiple select ops vs single select


 Misc
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Refactor to use true singletons/other patterns where systems require

 * Simulation package revival

 * DBUS support now that it's hit stable ABI at 1.0?
