		- Delta radius sweeps from center to cursor pos like following a circle
	- Fix scale cursor
	- Fix bone world coord

	- Interactive Tristrip creation tool to replace the old point and connect
   	  polgon creation some people seem to love

 Animation
	- Vertex keyframes
	- Bone H-matrix / inverted H-matrix
	  Bones with transforms in/outside of hierarchy
	- New skeleton system
	- New Keyframe animation system

	- Various joint types: hinge, b&s, etc
	- IK solver for skeletal animation
	- Deform skeletal mesh animation with animation blending
	- Timer for animation playback and keyframe timing


 Cursor operations
	- Vertex ops undo
	- Render changes and constantly update
	- When confirmed by click actually modify
	- Opposite mouse click 'undo' by not modifying
	- Don't scale cursor
	- Cursor rotation pivot setting for vertices


 Event system
	- Sync up 'toggles' using direct sets and feedback events ala spinnas
	- Remove default settings for 'toggles' in future?
	- Logger system refinement { Undo, Redo, Macro, Playback }
	- Enforce usage of Observer and Command patterns for all events


 Rendering
	- Animated textures
	- Normal maps, DOT3, and maybe matrix palette skinning support if begged
	- glColorMaterial use
	- Shadow maps
	- Different skyboxes/floors for animation view
	- Arrays to fill of verts/faces/etc in a render mesh
	- New renderer for new mesh system
		- Local vs World for mesh owned objects / atoms


 Interface
	- Sphere shaped brushes for input ( like magnets and paint selection )
	- Reimplement and enable Camera system
	- Add camera editing back
	- Viewport view / control abstraction
	- Point / edge / face / mesh editing tools
	- Mark groups by face select
	- Normal editor / Extrude guide / Control point view
	- Extrude multiple adj faces
	- Merge adj faces
	- Selection masks saving as layers?
	- Guided UV unwrap ( face pick )
	- Multiple select ops vs single select
	- MsgBox assert system to fix errors faster
	- Visibility layers using flags
	- Skinning tools
		- Full featured skinning system
		- Bbox/Sphere/Magnet vertex picker for weighting
	- 3d text using just libfreetype
	- Breakup GUI into modules
	- Object proprieties dialog?
	- Hidden property / Show object
  	- [d] Tree view for all objects in scene


 Subsystem specific
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 libmgtk
	- Mlisp to replace Resource
	- MlispEvent to replace ResourceEvent
	- Radio buttons / boxes
	- Toggle settings should be factored out to event functions to set value
	- Tree widget abstraction
	- Mlisp doesn't lookup symbols for like "true" if just setq
	- Mlisp wish list: garbage collection, fully featured lisp


 libfreyja
	- Documentation
	- State machine should only use C API for abstraction
	- Fix Collapse edges, etc req vertex refs
	- Add vertex/polygon list based texcoord mapping methods to ABI
	- Add subdiv algorithms like catmull-clark, n-patches, etc
	- Add polymesh CSG back 
		- Polygon CSG face intersection
	- Subdivision Loop and Sabin/Doo surfaces
	- Mesh/Vertex mirroring
	- Mesh smoothing
	- Normal smoothing
	- Polygon groups
	- Polymapped normal support?
	- Primitives: Cone / Disk / Cylinder ? ( Not polygonal )
	- API standard Interfaces for 'Copy/cut/paste' and 'Rot/Pos/Scale/etc'
	- freyjaPak*
		- Encryption support
		- Direct set functions to import / export
		- New vfs plugin UI
		- Buffered/fileread/filewrite file plugin interface

 plugins
	- Find and fix all the bugs caused by all new backend
	- Check PSK and Halflife unit tests for anim
	- Finish LinageII import for all versions of the game
	- Editor plugins in freyja using:
	  freyja_append_eventid, event system, and freyja_append_item_to_menu
	- Finish LineageII pak vfs plugin
	- Add Oblivion plugin?

 Freyja 0.10.x ( Dancer branch merge )
 =====================================================================

 Merge with 0.10 libfreyja
   - Break 0.9.x ABI / API and replace with 0.10 ABI/API
   - Backport freyja dancer keyframes
   - Seperate smoothing groups and clusters ( vertex groups )
     - Smoothing groups as vertex flags
   - Move vertex 'frames' to keyframes of vertex transforms
   - Merge new freyja 0.10 editor features and plugins
   - Storage of bone rotation as euler, rotation with quats ( all quats now )
   - Curves support for keyframes

 Merge free and view edit window interfaces
   - Refactor to use true singletons/other patterns where systems require
     - Break up Render/Control into 'controls with views'
   - Finish up viewport editing test
   - Rewrite renderer to use viewports for views correctly
   - Billboard/sprite support outside edit data for user diagrams and icons
   - Rewrite the UI to use 3d cursor w/ undo/redo/init events 
     - Hook up 3d cursor modes to offset bboxes for the cursor's axies
     - Run id maps over types to allow undo/redo to allow for cut/copy/paste 

 Paint interface
	- 3d paint ( for normal maps? )
	- DMAP geometery brush interface
	- Point vertex color/paint
	- Paint on texture with GIMP interface hooks

 Splines and Simulation packages
	- Considering...
