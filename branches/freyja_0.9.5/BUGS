 Known bugs
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A
 ----------------------------

 * WIN32 python lib is very unstable ( like that's my problem )  ;)

 * Faces... can't Select/UnSelect/etc which would make sense

 * Rotation with cursor is broken

 * Extrude ( legacy replacement ) broken for non-closed mesh

 * hel::Matrix sometimes 'misplaces' the translation col, so far it seems only
   a few methods have the issue, but this shows it needs refactor =(

 * Render Faces... has no transforms 'previews' (could use vertex blend buffer)

 * Crash on multiple merge with 'created' objects, but not imported

 * Crash on repeated failed compile / linking with shaders ( driver issue? )

 * UV viewmode in Model tab editor doesn't work the same as UV tab editor

 * Keyframe and cursor transforms 'fight' each other during editing
   FIX this in FreyjaRender by having a special mode for this case

 * Fix UV unwrap
	- Projection across boundries ( axes ) aren't handled
	- No fitting functionality
	- No overlap fixup provided


 B
 ----------------------------

 * 'Size' cursor has interesting recentering... it's correct, but maybe it
   should floor on a y value to avoid confusing people?

 * Extruding faces can cause invalid mesh pieces for odd topologies

 * Model transforms with cursor have 'jump' - temp workaround is to 'tap' cursor
	after a 'jump'

 * Multi-mesh .Ja v1 export is broken... use .Freyja export instead for now
	- Fix will be using a pure serialized format .Ja v2 ( binary .Freyja )

 * Bone rotation
	- Needs to be 'synced' to heirachry to make sense
	- Doesn't work at all really with backend changes
	- Looks like we're getting a sqrt(-1) and INFINITY passed around

 * Cursor axis select might be broke for some views on 'ALL' picks

 * Cursor reset on undo ( use a freaking seperate undo state system for cursor )

 * What happened to ray picking for UV faces in UV editor?


 C
 ----------------------------

 * Doesn't build in OS X since 0.9.5  ( No access to a machine atm )

 * Visual scaling of cursors may need to be adjusted during zoom != 1.0f
	- This means sphere/ray targets must be scaled to match visual also

 * Actual bug report: 'generated sphere looks retarded' it's true too
   just needs to be subdiv with quads

 * Skeleton tree widget not cleared on Close / New

 * Plugins
	- All iterator use is now not just deprecated but obsoloete ( rewrite )
	- I guess I forgot to port some plugins to support 64bit/big endian oops
	- Halflife is broken ( looks like a deformed umbra loader, 
	  which now we 'expand' deformed ( skinned ) meshes an collaspe back later )
	- PSK skeleton broken
	- GRN skeleton broken
	- Milkshape export broken

 * Reverse engineer plugin spin buttons don't always update
	- Tabbing always updates
	- Sometimes typing space and enter updates.. weird Gtk+ events

 * Certain modes like vertex transforms should prob enable point rendering
   by default
