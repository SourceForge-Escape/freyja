 Fix queue.
 ----------------------------
 
 * FIX mstl::list - push_back, etc have bugs ( need unit tests )

 * FIX Save As.. dialog triggers twice with text entry event.
	- Make this *.freyja only and using the one-off choosers to fix.
	- Related fix the material Save As... also
		. Also add recent files for material for the hell of it.

 * FIX Lineage II import directly from pak vfs.


 
 A - Serious bugs
 ----------------------------

 * Fix UV generation causes crash with some OBJ imported meshes.
	- Needs more information.

 * [UNCONFIRMED] Repacking might break aging Undo system for some operations.
	- This is bug is only a theory based on how undo works for objects.

 * Crash in win32 OpenGL on md5 model import in VMWare.
	- Needs more information.

 * File corruption with .freyja format with certain animations.
	- This should be 'fixed' when the old keyframe system is replaced.

 * File export won't work for virtual modules.
	- Explicit *.freyja filter won't save for example, since it's not a module.

 * Import model dialog bug.
	- Canceling attempts to open "Open..." dialog's selected extension.

 * UV viewmode in Model tab editor doesn't work the same as UV tab editor.
	- Clicking in the viewport must reset edit mode for this to work.
	- This depends on the viewport UI redesign.


 B - Moderate bugs
 ----------------------------

 * Extruding faces can cause invalid mesh pieces for open mesh topologies.

 * Model transforms with cursor have 'jump' - temp workaround is to 'tap' cursor
	after a 'jump'

 * Cursor reset on undo 
	- Use a separate undo state system for cursor, or store extra state.


 C - Annoying bugs
 ----------------------------

 * Models loading w/o complete materials often are alpha masked.
	- This is a plugin bug caused by plugins not requesting enough material ids.

 * Mesh rotator for box and cursor are unmatched!

 * Plugins
	- Some plugins don't support 64bit/big endian still.
	- Halflife
		. Freyja 0.9.5 takes unweighted mesh, so unweight the mesh. 
	- PSK
		. Skeleton incorrect.
	- GRN 
		. Skeleton incorrect.

 * ReverseEngineer plugin's spinbuttons don't always update value.
	- Tabbing always updates.
	- Sometimes typing space and enter updates.. weird Gtk+ events.


Regression notes
---------------------------------------------------

* I can't select UVs in UV editor!
	- Depends on material:mesh Id if UVs are selectable.

* The OpenGL window is pitch black!
	- This is caused by corrupted user preferences mlisp. ( rare )

* When modal dialogs fail to cancel.
	- This is caused by build optimizations with Gtk+ wrapper.
