 Known bugs
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A
 ----------------------------

 * Merge, etc can cause bounding volumes to deform

 * Crash / vertex clean-up broke current mesh merge implementation

 * Render Faces... transforms 'previews' (could use vertex blend buffer)

 * Doesn't build in OS X since 0.9.5  ( No access to a machine atm )

 * Crash on repeated failed compile / linking with shaders ( driver issue? )

 * Quad ray pick sucks - fix it  ;_;

 * UV viewmode in Model tab editor doesn't work the same as UV tab editor

 * Copy / Cut / Paste 
    - New mesh copy system doesn't buffer, since copy = copy + paste
	- Use fHidden flag to temp buffer meshes, and avoid it's use in raypick, etc

 * Scale tool sucks it's so broke nothing works properly
	- Keyframe scaling edits geometery instead of keyframe
	- Mesh scaling on Y 'hops' during preview, but is correct when transformed
    - Face rotate, scale doesn't work in interface

 * Keyframe and cursor transforms 'fight' each other during editing
   FIX this in FreyjaRender by having a special mode for this case

 * Fix UV unwrap
	- Projection across boundries ( axes ) aren't handled
	- No fitting functionality
	- No overlap fixup provided


 B
 ----------------------------

 * Model transforms with cursor have 'jump' - temp workaround is to 'tap' cursor
	after a 'jump'

 * Multi-mesh .Ja v1 export is broken... use .Freyja export instead for now
	- Fix will be using a pure serialized format .Ja v2 ( binary .Freyja )

 * Issue with overwrite in file dialog
	- Often prompts to overwrite twice, since the event fires twice
	- It shouldn't save and then save again!
	- This is due to odd Gtk+ signal handling when a question dialog is fired
	  while the file dialog is active.  Checking to see if gtk+ update helps.

 * Bone rotation
	- Needs to be 'synced' to heirachry to make sense
	- Doesn't work at all really with backend changes
	- Looks like we're getting a sqrt(-1) and INFINITY passed around

 * Cursor axis select might be broke for some views on 'ALL' picks

 * Cursor reset on undo ( use a freaking seperate undo state system for cursor )

 * What happened to ray picking for UV faces in UV editor?


 C
 ----------------------------

 * Visual scaling of cursors may need to be adjusted during zoom != 1.0f
	- This means sphere/ray targets must be scaled to match visual also

 * Actual bug report: 'generated sphere looks retarded' it's true too
   just needs to be subdiv with quads

 * Skeleton tree widget not cleared on Close / New

 * Plugins
	- All iterator use is now not just deprecated but obsoloete ( rewrite )
		- 3ds export is broken
		- ASE export is broken
	- I guess I forgot to port some plugins to support 64bit/big endian oops
	- Halflife is broken ( looks like a deformed umbra loader, 
	  which now we 'expand' deformed ( skinned ) meshes an collaspe back later )
	- PSK skeleton broken
	- GRN skeleton broken

 * Reverse engineer plugin spin buttons don't always update
	- Tabbing always updates
	- Sometimes typing space and enter updates.. weird Gtk+ events

 * Certain modes like vertex transforms should prob enable point rendering
   by default
