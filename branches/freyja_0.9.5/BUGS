 =====================================================================

 
 A - Serious bugs
 ----------------------------

 * UNCONFIRMED Repacking might break aging Undo system for some operations.

 * .freyja file format sometimes corrupts with certain animations.

 * CRASH on animation scrub with md5 model!  2007.06.15

 * File export may be broken in some event paths 
	- explict freyja filter won't save -- prob due to it not being a module

 * *.smd import bug ( Canceling attempts to open Open... extention. )

 * Group (faces) selection is broken

 * Extrude ( legacy replacement ) broken for non-closed mesh

 * Render Faces... has no transforms 'previews' (could use vertex blend buffer)

 * Crash on multiple merge with 'created' objects, but not imported

 * UV viewmode in Model tab editor doesn't work the same as UV tab editor

 * Fix UV unwrap
	- Projection across boundries ( axes ) aren't handled
	- No fitting functionality
	- No overlap fixup provided


 B - Moderate bugs
 ----------------------------

 * Save As.. dialog triggers twice with text entry event.

 * 'Size' cursor has interesting recentering... it's correct, but maybe it
   should floor on a y value to avoid confusing people?

 * Extruding faces can cause invalid mesh pieces for odd topologies

 * Model transforms with cursor have 'jump' - temp workaround is to 'tap' cursor
	after a 'jump'

 * Cursor reset on undo ( use a freaking seperate undo state system for cursor )


 C - Annoying bugs
 ----------------------------

 * Models loading w/o complete materials often are alpha masked. ( plugins issue )

 * Mesh rotator for box and cursor are unmatched!

 * May not build in OS X anymore.  ( No longer have access to a mac. )

 * Actual bug report: 'generated sphere looks retarded' it's true too
   just needs to be subdiv with quads

 * Plugins
	- I guess I forgot to port some plugins to support 64bit/big endian oops
	- Halflife is broken ( looks like a deformed umbra loader, 
	  which now we 'expand' deformed ( skinned ) meshes an collaspe back later )
	- PSK skeleton broken
	- GRN skeleton broken

 * Reverse engineer plugin spin buttons don't always update
	- Tabbing always updates
	- Sometimes typing space and enter updates.. weird Gtk+ events


Regression notes
---------------------------------------------------

* Modal dialogs fail to cancel.
	- Likely caused by build optimazations.
