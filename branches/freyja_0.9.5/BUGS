 Known bugs
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Bone rotation needs to be 'synced' to heirachry to make sense

 * Copy / Cut / Paste not fully working with meshes anymore

 * Cursor axis select might be broke for some views on 'ALL' picks

 * Reverse engineer plugin spin buttons don't always update
	- Tabbing always updates
	- Sometimes typing space and enter updates.. weird

 * New mesh copy system doesn't buffer, since copy = copy + paste

 * Cursor reset on undo ( use a freaking seperate undo state system for cursor )

 * Plugins
	- I guess I forgot to port some plugins to support 64bit/big endian oops
	- Halflife is broken ( looks like a deformed umbra loader, 
	  which now we 'expand' deformed ( skinned ) meshes an collaspe back later )
	- 3ds is broken
	- MD3 is broken
	- ASE is broken
	- PSK skeleton broken
	- GRN skeleton broken

 * Certain modes like vertex transforms should prob enable point rendering

 * JA v1 doesn't seem to save out multimesh anymore ( oops )

 * Fix UV projection to handle cross boundries ( axes )

 * Quad ray pick sucks - fix it  ;_;

 * Scaling on cursors needs fixing during zoom

 * Actual bug report: 'generated sphere looks retarded' it's true too
   just needs to be subdiv with quads
 
 * Keyframe and cursor transforms 'fight' each other during editing
   FIX this in FreyjaRender by having a special mode for this case

 * What happened to ray picking for UV faces in UV editor?

 * Scale tool sucks it's so broke nothing works properly
	- Keyframe scaling edits geometery instead of keyframe
	- Scale cursor doesn't stretch all pretty and useless like!

 * Face rotate, scale doesn't work in interface

 * Skeleton tree widget not cleared on Close / New

 * Bone componet creation is broken / not completely hooked up
