 Known bugs

 - Keyframes should be able to use the Transform Box during animation

 - Keyframes should keep transform of last keyframe as init
   to avoid interpolation issues ( eg extra rotation in 'tweens )
   FIX this in the backend to "to it right" during allocation of new frame
 
 - Keyframe and cursor transforms 'fight' each other during editing
   FIX this in FreyjaRender by having a special mode for this case

	- Keyframe scaling edits geometery instead of keyframe

 - Skeleton tree widget not cleared on Clear()

 - Rotation cursor doesn't work using rings yet

 - Scale cursor doesn't work with stretch yet

 - Bone rotate only works on Front
