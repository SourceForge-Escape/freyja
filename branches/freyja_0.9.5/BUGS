 =====================================================================

 
 A - Serious bugs
 ----------------------------

 * UNCONFIRMED Repacking might break aging Undo system for some operations.

 * File corruption with .freyja format with certain animations.
	- This should be 'fixed' when the old keyframe system is replaced.

 * File export may be broken in some event paths 
	- Explict freyja filter won't save -- prob due to it not being a module

 * Import *.smd dialog bug.
	- Canceling attempts to open "Open..."'s extention.

 * UV viewmode in Model tab editor doesn't work the same as UV tab editor


 B - Moderate bugs
 ----------------------------

 * Save As.. dialog triggers twice with text entry event.

 * Extruding faces can cause invalid mesh pieces for odd topologies

 * Model transforms with cursor have 'jump' - temp workaround is to 'tap' cursor
	after a 'jump'

 * Cursor reset on undo 
	- Use a seperate undo state system for cursor, or store extra state.


 C - Annoying bugs
 ----------------------------

 * Models loading w/o complete materials often are alpha masked.
	- This is a plugin bug caused by plugins not requesting enough material ids.

 * Mesh rotator for box and cursor are unmatched!

 * May not build in OS X anymore.  
	- No longer have access to a mac, so feel free to donate a mini.

 * Plugins
	- Some plugins don't support 64bit/big endian still.
	- Halflife
		. Freyja 0.9.5 takes unweighted mesh, so unweight the mesh. 
	- PSK
		. Skeleton incorrect.
	- GRN 
		. Skeleton incorrect.

 * Reverse engineer plugin spinbuttons don't always update
	- Tabbing always updates
	- Sometimes typing space and enter updates.. weird Gtk+ events


Regression notes
---------------------------------------------------

* When modal dialogs fail to cancel.
	- Likely caused by build optimazations with gtk+ wrapper.
