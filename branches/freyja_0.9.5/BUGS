 =======================================================================
 
 A - Serious bugs
 ----------------------------

 * [NEEDS INFO] Fix UV generation causes crash with some OBJ imported meshes.

 * [NEEDS INFO] Crash in win32 OpenGL on md5 model import in VMWare.

 * [NEEDS INFO] Lua will loop if icons / rc data aren't found.

 * File corruption with .freyja format with certain animations.
	- This should be 'fixed' when the old keyframe system is replaced.

 * File export won't work for virtual modules.
	- Explicit *.freyja filter won't save for example, since it's not a module.

 * Import model dialog bug.
	- Canceling attempts to open dialog's selected extension.

 * UV viewmode in Model tab editor doesn't work the same as UV tab editor.
	- This is a design bug.
	- Clicking in the viewport must reset edit mode for this to work.
	- This depends on the viewport UI redesign.


 B - Moderate bugs
 ----------------------------

 * [NEEDS INFO] Material load texture id set broken with Lua UI.

 * Extruding faces can cause invalid mesh pieces for open mesh topologies.

 * Model mode transforms with cursor have 'jump'.
	- A workaround is to 'tap' cursor after a 'jump'.
	- Depends on Model based backend as opposed to Mesh/Skeleton.

 * Cursor reset on undo 
	- Use a separate undo state system for cursor, or store extra state.


 C - Annoying bugs
 ----------------------------

 * FIX Lineage II import directly from pak vfs.

 * Models loading w/o complete materials often are alpha masked.
	- This is a plugin bug caused by plugins not requesting enough material ids.

 * Mesh rotation for box and cursor are unmatched.

 * Some plugins don't support 64bit/big endian properly still.
	
 * Halflife plugin needs to unweight the mesh for 0.9.5 ABI. 

 * PSK plugin's skeleton import is now incorrect for 0.9.5.

 * GRN plugin's skeleton import is now incorrect for 0.9.5.

 * Debian tarballs have svn metadata in them.


 NOTES
 ---------------------------------------------------

 * I can't select UVs in UV editor!
	- Depends on material:mesh Id if UVs are selectable.
	- This is by design and not a bug.  ( Request design change )

 * The OpenGL window is pitch black!
	- This can be caused by an unstable filesystem. ( rare )
	- This is caused by corrupted user preferences mlisp. ( rare )
	- If you experience this just go to Preferences and click 'default colors'.

 * Modal dialogs fail to cancel.
	- This is caused by build optimizations with Gtk+ wrapper callback.

 * Spinbuttons don't always update value for embedded plugins.
	- Tabbing always updates.
	- Sometimes typing space and enter triggers an update.
	- This is a Gtk+ bug that shouldn't be encountered anymore.
