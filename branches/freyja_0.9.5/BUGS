 Known bugs

 - Reverse engineer plugin isn't taking values correctly from spin buttons

 - New mesh copy system doesn't buffer, since copy = copy + paste

 - Cursor reset on undo ( use a freaking seperate undo state system )

 - Plugins
	- I guess I forgot to port some plugins to support 64bit/big endian oops
	- Halflife is broken ( looks like a deformed umbra loader, 
	  which now we 'expand' deformed ( skinned ) meshes an collaspe back later )
	- 3ds is broken
	- MD3 is broken
	- ASE is broken
	- PSK skeleton broken
	- GRN skeleton broken

 - Certain modes like vertex transforms should prob enable point rendering

 - JA v1 doesn't seem to save out multimesh anymore ( oops )

 - Fix UV projection to handle cross boundries ( axes )

 - Quad ray pick sucks - fix it  ;_;

 - Scaling on cursors needs fixing during zoom

 - Actual bug report: 'generated sphere looks retarded' it's true too
   just needs to be subdiv with quads

 - Material name textbox not updating?

 - Keyframes should keep transform of last keyframe as init
   to avoid interpolation issues ( eg extra rotation in 'tweens )
   FIX this in the backend to "to it right" during allocation of new frame
 
 - Keyframe and cursor transforms 'fight' each other during editing
   FIX this in FreyjaRender by having a special mode for this case

 - What happened to ray picked UV faces in UV editor?

 - Orbital/Free view ray pick is off only when you translate the editor scene

 - Scale tool sucks it's so broke nothing works properly
	- Keyframe scaling edits geometery instead of keyframe

 - Face scale, scale doesn't work

 - Skeleton tree widget not cleared on Clear()

 - Scale cursor doesn't work with stretch yet

 - Bone rotate only works on Front

 - Bone componet creation is broken / not completely hooked up

 - Box buttons look like labels to people
