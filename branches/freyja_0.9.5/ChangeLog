     - Remove concept of mesh 'groups/frames'
     - Move vertex 'frames' to keyframes of vertex transforms
   - Remove model dependency on concept of edit planes { XY, YZ, XZ }
   - Merge new freyja 0.10 editor features and plugins
   - Purge unused classes
   - Storage of bone rotation as euler, rotation with quats ( all quats now )

   - Finish up viewport editing test
   - Rewrite renderer to use viewports for views correctly
   - Billboard/sprite support outside edit data for user diagrams and icons
   - Default 'zoom' to x1
   - Rewrite the UI to use 3d cursor w/ undo/redo/init events 
     - Hook up virtual planes in free mode using pickray ( cubes )
     - Hook up 3d cursor modes to offset bboxes for the cursor's axies
     - Run maps over types to allow undo/redo to allow for cut/copy/paste
