 1. Use the C++ template generator for new classes.
 2. Document all methods with Pre/Post conditions.
 3. Use *tabs, not spaces.
 4. Use a newline on a new scope, don't do K&R.
 5. Use FIXME marker for code that needs fixing.
 6. Use EXPERIMENTAL marker for test code.
 7. Use OBSOLETE #ifdef to comment out old code.
 8. Only put comments in source if it's needed.
